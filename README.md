A utility site that provides a search interface for arcade games songs and sheets.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version or above)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Setup

```sh
# install dependencies
yarn install
```

- Make a copy of the `.env.example` file as `.env` and fill out the required fields.

## Local development data

While developing, the songs data is read from the local copy under `static/local-data/`
instead of the remote data source, so that no request is made to the CDN.

That directory is git-ignored and has to be filled in once. It mirrors the layout of
the remote data source, whose URL is listed per game in `data/sites.json`:

```
static/local-data/<gameCode>/data.json
static/local-data/<gameCode>/gallery.yaml       # only some games have one
static/local-data/<gameCode>/img/cover/<imageName>
static/local-data/<gameCode>/img/cover-m/<imageName>
static/local-data/<gameCode>/img/<iconUrl>      # type / difficulty icons, locked.png
```

- `<imageName>` is listed in `data.json` for every song and sheet. Note that the
  `any` game refers to the images of the other games by a relative path, so it has
  no images of its own.
- The remote data source is used instead whenever `data.json` is missing for any of
  the games, so the site still works before the copy is made.
- `LOCAL_DATA_BASE_URL` in `.env` overrides all of the above.

## Development

```sh
# serve with hot reload at localhost
yarn run dev

# serve with hot reload on local network
yarn run dev:host
```

- For a detailed explanation of each directory, check out the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxtjs.org).

## Build for production

### Static hosting with SSG (recommended)

```sh
# Build the application (if needed), generate every route as a HTML file and statically export to dist/ directory (used for static hosting).
yarn run generate

# serve the dist/ directory like your static hosting would do (Netlify, Vercel, Surge, etc), great for testing before deploying.
yarn run serve
```

### Server hosting with SSR

```sh
# Build and optimize your application with webpack for production.
yarn run build

# Start the production server (after running nuxt build). Use it for Node.js hosting like Heroku, Digital Ocean, etc.
yarn run start
```
